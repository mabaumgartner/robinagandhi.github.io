    <title>PURPOSE
The goal of this pocket guide is to promote the development of educational and training materials and programs to prepare a workforce more capable of securing software and applications.
This pocket guide compiles software assurance education and training resources aimed to ensure adequate coverage of requisite knowledge areas and the corresponding roles in the workforce. In doing so it draws upon contributing disciplines such as software engineering (including its many sub-disciplines, such as programming), systems engineering and analysis, project management, etc., to identify and acquire competencies associated with secure software.  
The Software Assurance Pocket Guide Series is developed in collaboration with the SwA Forum and Working Groups and provides summary material in a more consumable format.  The series provides informative material for SwA initiatives that seek to reduce software vulnerabilities, minimize exploitation, and address ways to improve the routine development, acquisition and deployment of trustworthy software products.  Together, these activities will enable more secure and reliable software, software that supports mission requirements across enterprises and the critical infrastructure.
