CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
The software does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.
Extended Description
This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.

CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.
